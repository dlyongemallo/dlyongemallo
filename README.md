### About me

I am a software engineer working on machine learning and quantum computing. Some of the projects I'm currently working on:

- [PyZX](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx) - Python library for quantum circuit rewriting and optimisation using the ZX-calculus.
- [ZXLive](https://github.com/Quantomatic/zxlive) - A graphical tool for the ZX-calculus, implemented using Qt/PySide6.
- [Qiskit ZX Transpiler](https://github.com/dlyongemallo/qiskit-zx-transpiler) - A transpiler pass for Qiskit which uses ZX-Calculus for circuit optimization, implemented using PyZX.

I am also the creator and maintainer of the **boQwI'** [Klingon language suite](https://github.com/De7vID/klingon-assistant), which is managed using [another account](https://github.com/De7vID):

- [Android app](https://github.com/De7vID/klingon-assistant-android) - A lexicon dictionary and grammar analysis tool.
- [Android TTS](https://github.com/De7vID/klingon-assistant-tts-android) - A Text-To-Speech engine for Klingon.
- [iOS port](https://github.com/dadap/flingon-assister) (by [dadap](https://github.com/dadap)) - An iOS version of the Android app.
