### About me

I am a software engineer working on quantum computing. Some of the projects I'm currently working on:

- [PyZX](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx) - Python library for quantum circuit rewriting and optimisation using the ZX-calculus.
- [ZXLive](https://github.com/Quantomatic/zxlive) - A graphical tool for the ZX-calculus.
- [Qiskit ZX Transpiler](https://github.com/dlyongemallo/qiskit-zx-transpiler) - A transpiler pass for Qiskit which uses ZX-Calculus for circuit optimization, implemented using PyZX.

I am also the creator and maintainer of the **boQwI'** Klingon-language suite, which is managed using [another account](https://github.com/De7vID).
